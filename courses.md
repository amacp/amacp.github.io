# Courses
## Probability and Stochastic Stochastic Proceses in Biology ([Website](https://amacp.github.io/Math468/))
- Last taught in Spring 2024, website may not be maintained

The natural world is inherently random. Describing, understanding, and predicting phenomena in Ecology, Evolution, and Epidemiology therefore requires the use of mathematical models that explicitly include this randomness. In this course we will cover methods and applications of probability, stochastic processes, and computer simulation to these three fields.

## Matheamtics of Evolution ([Website](https://amacp.github.io/APMA990/))
- Last taught in Spring 2023, website may not be maintained

Much of our understanding of evolution, the process shaping the beautiful biological diversity in our world, is grounded in equally elegant mathematics. In this course we will cover the mathematical description of evolution. Involving a wide range of topics, from the analysis of non-linear dynamics to stochastic processes, and game theory, this course will challenge you to take mathematical principals and apply them to the natural world.

## Matheamatical Epidemiology ([Website](https://amacp.github.io/Math496/))
- Last taught in Spring 2022, website may not be maintained

The aim of this course is to introduce the fundemental mathematical tools and survey contemporary methods used to understand and forcast epidemic dynamics and their use to inform public health policy. As a rapidly changing field, this course will focus on developing our ability to understand, analyze, and apply the recent scientific literature.
