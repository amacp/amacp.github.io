I am interested in phylogenetics. In particular Ancestral State Reconstruction methods which are widely used in phylogenetics for identifying the character states of evolutionary ancestors.  I am also interested in using mathematical models of infectious diseases to study how diseases spread.

I have a wide range of research interests that are motivated by biological applications. My current work involves using epidemiology and evolutionary approaches to examine bark beetle infestations. Iâ€™m interested in exploring multi-scale questions that occur in a variety of fields, broadly speaking falling under the following categories:
<br/> 
1. Investigating the dynamics within the host (tree) using computational fluid dynamics approaches.
2. Creating a brand-new model to depict an outbreak of the bark beetle while refining the presumptions made in earlier literature studies. and evaluating the severity of many parameters to limit the outbreak.
3. Examining issues brought up in the study of evolution, such as local adaptation.
