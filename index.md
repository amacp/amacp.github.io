# Bio:

I donâ€™t like math. I *love* math. Particularly, as applied to evolution and population genetics. 
My research program is aimed at addressing fundamental questions in ecology and evolution through the lens of infectious diseases.Viruses, in particular, provide a unique opportunity to address eco-evolutionary questions, specifically coevolutionary ones, due to their rapid mutation rates and the extensive availability of genomic data.  However, as many viruses are transmitted directly from host to host, examining coevolution in these systems requires developing a fully integrated ecological-epidemiological-evolutionary (E3) framework.  My research aims are hence two-fold. First, I develop the mathematical and statistical methods at the ecology-evolution-epidemiology interface. Second, I use these computational tools to address fundamental questions in these three fields.

I recently completed my Ph.D. at the University of British Columbia, Canada, where I worked with [Dr. Sally Otto](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~otto/) and am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Toronto in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. My PhD thesis focused on coevolution in the context of infectious disease. I explored how coevolution affects disease dynamics and vice versa, how coevolution affects our ability to identify disease genes, and how ecological-coevolutionary and epidemiological-coevolutionary feedbacks shape host genetic variation. My postdoctoral has focused on the development and analysis of phylodynamics methods in which phylogenetic anlaysis of viral genome seuqences are used to examine epidemiological dynamics.   

In addition to exploring the E3 intersection, I enjoy pondering a diverse set of evolutionary questions in topics including range expansion, hybridization, local adaptation, parallel evolution, and adaptation with gene flow. I was introduced to population genetics and evolutionary modelling by [Dr. Scott Nuismer](https://www.leeef.org/)  at the University of Idaho, U.S., where we worked on several theoretical and statistical models in evolution.
